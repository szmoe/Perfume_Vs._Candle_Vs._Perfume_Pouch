This report is a record of my learning experience during the decision analysis course. 

Comments on what I learned from lectures, seminars and reading materials are written here. 

The seminar exercises of each week are replicated using the [Essential Oils Data set](https://github.com/szmoe/Perfume_Vs._Candle_Vs._Perfume_Pouch/blob/main/Essential_Oils.csv), as and when possible. The original data set has 300 entries, but I will only use the first page of the data set to maintain visual simplicity. 

## Week 1

### Lecture 1: Introduction

The course kicked off with a lecture on "Decision-focused agricultural research." It was a very nice lecture, and the explanation was very clear and to the point. But I must admit I had prejudice against the lecture, and I deeply regret it now. I came from dietetic background, and the first thing I learned about research was how to criticize research papers. I was told to find faults, criticize them "mercilessly" and "shred them apart." One of the things I was taught to look out for was vague methodology or "the uncertainties." I was listening as a dietitian when I first heard the lecture on decision analysis. Alarm bells were ringing in my head, and instead of listening to the lecture, I was quietly formulating how to work around the uncertainties to make things more certain. How wrong I was!

I now understand the decision analysis approach is not to replace the traditional nutrition research but to complete it. My previous research goals were to find new evidence and new association. It was so specialized that I had little thoughts about their applicability in the real world and what it would take to apply the research findings as projects. And the decision analysis approach can help fill that gap, I suppose. If the traditional researcher is an introverted genius, the decision analyst is their extroverted counterpart, the master planner. One will innovate an idea, and the other will turn it into reality. That's what I realize when I was practicing the models. I was surprised when I revisited the lecture slides today to write this report. The questions that have been running in my head in the past few days, while I was brainstorming to work on the third model, were all mentioned in the slides. The answers were already given to me, when I didn't know what to question yet. I missed the valuable knowledge because of my ignorance. Now it is too late to go back in time and listen to the lecture again. 

Thus, the greatest lesson from lecture 1 is to keep an open mind when learning a new thing. Trust the teacher wholeheartedly, sweep doubts aside, just listen and learn!



### Seminar 1

I learned how to install R, R studio and how to operate the R studio interface. I also learned how to store files appropriately, making the use of directory. The seminar 1 video also taught me how to install packages and call help function. So, I learned the very basics of R in seminar 1.
