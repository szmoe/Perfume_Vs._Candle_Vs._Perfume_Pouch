This report is a record of my learning experience during the decision analysis course. 

Comments on what I learned from lectures and reading materials are written here. 

The seminar exercise of each week are replicated using the [Essential Oils Data set](https://github.com/szmoe/Perfume_Vs._Candle_Vs._Perfume_Pouch/blob/main/Essential_Oils.csv), as and when possible. The original data set has 300 entries, but I will only use the first page of the data set to maintain visual simplicity.
